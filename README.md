## Future improvements

There is lots of room for improvement and new features. Here are some next steps we are considering for exploration:

* Allowing the user to choose between different color schemes that can be used to color the treemap's cells.
* Display to the user the domain of their sizing and coloring attributes and where their selected EF falls on that domain.
